I've always loved music, and from a young age I wanted to make my own. At age 12 I got my first guitar and I've been loving
it ever since. By age 15 I was recording my own tracks with a crappy little microphone and the open-source DAW Audacity.

I've upgraded my tools since then, but my fundamental goal remains the same: to make great tunes and have fun doing it.
I work in a variety of genres, including folk, country, alt rock, classic rock, punk rock, electronic, and more. Let's bring your 
sonic vision to life together!
